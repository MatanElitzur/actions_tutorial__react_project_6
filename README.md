# Build custom action
This action will be created in this repository, for the use of this repository.
But we can build a custom action in a new repository and then several repositories can use it.

We are going to build the custom action at 
.github directory, you can name, choose the right name for the directory, I choose actions for the name of the directory .github/actions

Then we would create a directory that will represent the custom action process,
in our example .github/actions/cached-deps

Then we need to create an action.yml file inside it. This filr will be in any part of an action that we will create.
